A React Native client for [Segment](https://segment.com). The hassle-free way to integrate analytics into any application.

This library is based on its node counterpart, [analytics-node](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-node). Despite being designed to run on react-native, it will also work in browsers (via webpack or browserify) and even in nodejs. You only need to include [fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch) for browsers or [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) for nodejs or io.js.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install analytics-react-native
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [https://segment.com/libraries/node](https://segment.com/libraries/node).
